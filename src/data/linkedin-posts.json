So far, Claude Code and friends are the closest thing to a \u201cthought compiler\u201d that humanity has produced. Every time I open my laptop and fire up an AI coding agent, I'm on the edge of my seat leaning forward in amazement, with a feeling I haven\u2019t had since playing Wolfenstein 3D for the first time in 1992 (a game that helped popularize the FPS genre). \"\n\"\"\n\"With that kind of power on tap, I often run into this question: do I adopt an existing framework and its opinionated abstractions, or build the tool I actually want? There are many trade-offs to consider.\"\n\"\"\n\"I chose \"build my own\" for a recent experiment - a simplistic microblogging tool. I'm pleased so far, but how long will it stay simplistic? When will I decide that a tool like Jekyll, Hugo, or Gatsby is a better choice?\"\n\"\"\n\"https://lnkd.in/ePrtt3nZ",

Four days, including learning, research, and some refactoring.\"\n\"\"\n\"There\u2019s no way I could go back to doing development the old way. These tools collapse barriers: they shorten the learning curve, multiply output, and make it possible to move from idea to prototype at a faster pace.\"\n\"\"\n\"Now I have a living project to learn from and refine (it certainly needs it): reviewing the code and scripts, refactoring, and applying best practices as I pick up insights from human experts, blog posts, and agents.\"\n\"\"\n\"But speed isn\u2019t the whole story. Good output requires experience, judgment, small iterations, testing, and constant vigilance. The agent gets you moving fast\u2014but it\u2019s your craft that keeps things on track.
