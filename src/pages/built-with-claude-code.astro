          The Big Picture
        </h2>

        <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            This project started the way many do&mdash;with a folder full of scattered resources.
            LinkedIn exports, YouTube playlists, GitHub repos, blog posts across multiple platforms,
            speaking engagement histories. The kind of content that every professional accumulates
            over years but never has time to organize into anything cohesive.
          </p>

          <p>
            The difference here is that the folder was shared with Claude Code, an AI coding agent.
            And instead of manually sorting, formatting, and assembling everything myself, I described
            what I wanted and let the agent do the work.
          </p>

          <p>
            Claude Code read through the exported files, figured out their structures, and started building.
            It retrieved data from six different platforms&mdash;parsing RSS feeds, calling APIs, scraping
            HTML where no API existed&mdash;and normalized everything into a consistent format. When it
            needed to understand how personal showcase websites are typically structured, it researched
            patterns online. When I pointed it at a website whose visual style I liked, it studied the
            design and adapted it.
          </p>

          <p>
            The entire site&mdash;every page, every data pipeline, every deployment configuration&mdash;was
            built through this kind of back-and-forth conversation. I provided direction and judgment.
            The agent handled implementation at a pace no single developer could match.
          </p>

          <p>
            The broader point is this: if you collect your resources in one place and give an AI coding
            agent access, it can analyze, research, and synthesize across all of them&mdash;producing
            websites, documents, presentations, or whatever artifact you need. That's a fundamentally
            different workflow from building things by hand.

          <p>
            AI coding agents are remarkably good at the unglamorous work of data engineering&mdash;retrieving,
            parsing, transforming, joining, and manipulating data from heterogeneous sources. This site
            pulls from six of them, each requiring a different strategy:

            Claude Code wrote every refresh script, choosing the right approach for each source.
            Medium has a well-structured RSS feed, so a lightweight XML parser works.
            The Chariot blog has no API, so it required full HTML scraping with
            <code class="bg-navy-700 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded text-cyan-300 text-sm font-mono">cheerio</code>.
            LinkedIn posts come from a manual CSV export that gets normalized into the same JSON shape
            as everything else. The agent handled edge cases&mdash;malformed dates, missing fields,
            encoding issues&mdash;and produced consistent schemas across all of them.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-10 mb-6">Research and Design</h3>

        <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            Claude Code didn't just write code. It researched how personal showcase websites are
            typically structured, laid out, and styled. When I pointed it at
            <a href="https://astro.build" target="_blank" class="text-cyan-400 hover:text-cyan-300 transition-colors">astro.build</a>
            as a style reference, it studied the site's design language&mdash;the dark theme, the color
            system, the spacing&mdash;and adapted those patterns into the
            <a href="https://tailwindcss.com" target="_blank" class="text-cyan-400 hover:text-cyan-300 transition-colors">Tailwind</a>
            configuration and component library that drives this site. Getting from zero to a deployed,
            styled website happened remarkably fast because the agent could both research and implement
            in the same session.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-10 mb-6">Monolog Integration</h3>

        <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            One of the more satisfying pieces was incorporating
            <a href="https://github.com/sujankapadia/monolog" target="_blank" class="text-cyan-400 hover:text-cyan-300 transition-colors">Monolog</a>,
            a microblogging tool I built for myself. I originally vibe-coded it as a personal tool,
            then evolved it to be agent-friendly&mdash;adding informational help output from the CLI,
            especially around custom templates. Claude Code picked up the tool, understood its interface,
            built a custom template matching the site's theme, and wired it into the build pipeline.
            Multiple repos each maintain a
            <code class="bg-navy-700 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded text-cyan-300 text-sm font-mono">posts.md</code>
            file that gets aggregated and rendered at build time. The fact that an AI agent could adopt a
            tool I built, understand its conventions, and integrate it cleanly was a strong validation of
            designing tools with agent consumption in mind.
          </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-10 mb-6">The Developer Marketing Problem</h3>

        <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            Altogether, this project demonstrates something practical: it's now remarkably easy for a
            developer to market themselves, capture project information, and produce content&mdash;without
            ever leaving their engineering flow. No context-switching to a CMS. No wrestling with a
            website builder. Just a conversation with an agent that understands your codebase, your data,
            and your intent.
